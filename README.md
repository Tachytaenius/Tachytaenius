WIP readme.

pokestygian and pokehalls are excluded from the most used langauges list because I didn't write the vast majority of them, and they were making it look like I mostly wrote in assembly.

Literally never coded in PHP before in my life.
The language counter is wrong and I'll have to fix it.
